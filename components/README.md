## **Directory Structure**

This project is organized into several directories, each with a specific purpose:

**`common`**: Contains reusable components used in various parts of the application, including basic UI elements and domain-specific components.

**`modules`**: Hosts module components that represent specific functionalities of the application, encapsulating sets of related features.

**`ui`**: This directory is exclusively dedicated to components of the **[UI library](https://ui.shadcn.com/)**. It contains complex UI components and should only be used for components from this library.

Each of these directories is structured to keep the code organized, making navigation and development easier.
