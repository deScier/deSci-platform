## Whitepaper: Decentralized Scientific Publishing

### Abstract

The traditional scientific publishing model faces significant challenges including high costs, limited access, and centralized control. This document outlines SciDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization designed to revolutionize scientific publishing through blockchain technology, peer-to-peer networks, and community governance.

## Current Publishing Landscape

### Traditional Publishing Challenges
