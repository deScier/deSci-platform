Prompt: Please analyze my business idea of this decentralized scientific publishing desci.reviews for authors who need to build authority and credibility. Identify market gaps, high-potential niches, 3 competitors to watch, current trends, customer pain points & pricing insights

Market gaps
	•	Ownership void: authors routinely sign away rights/royalties; there’s demand for 100% copyright retention + on-chain proof. (APCs commonly $2k–$6k; Nature APC ≈ $12,290.) The Official PLOS Blognews.library.ualberta.ca
	•	Opaque peer review: need transparent, auditable review + reputational signals (open identities/reports/participation). Wikipedia
	•	Fragmented incentives: few venues share revenue with reviewers/curators; crypto-native rev-share is rare.
	•	Author UX pain: web3 tools feel complex; need wallet-optional, 1-page submissions.
High-potential niches
	•	Student capstones/early-career (TCC Journal): fast credibility + portfolio assets.
	•	Underserved/controversial domains (biohacking, legal engineering, niche computational fields) where legacy journals gatekeep.
	•	Method, dataset, and negative-result papers (poorly served by prestige venues; high reuse value).
	•	Global South authors facing APC costs and access barriers. PLOSOffice of Scholarly Communication
3 competitors to watch
	•	ResearchHub – tokenized community for sharing/reviewing papers; rewards via RSC; bounty mechanics. Good at engagement, weaker at formal publishing. ResearchHub+1ResearchHub Foundation
	•	OpenReview – best-in-class open peer-review infrastructure (confs/journals); not crypto-native, but sets the transparency bar. OpenReview+1
	•	Orvium – blockchain scholarly platform (CERN spin-off) for journals/conferences; focuses on lifecycle + proof-of-existence. orvium.ioOrvium
Trends to leverage
	•	APC fatigue & backlash (rising fees; libraries/consortia renegotiating). The Official PLOS BlogSpringer Nature
	•	Shift to open/transparent review and post-publication curation. Wikipedia
	•	On-chain provenance for authorship, versions, and data citation.
	•	Alt-metrics and community signals beating journal prestige in hiring/funding decisions (early but growing).
	•	Policy pressure to free publicly funded research, weakening the paywall oligopoly. The Australian
Customer pain points (your solve)
	•	Lost rights & royalties → keep 100% copyright, programmable licenses.
	•	Slow, opaque review → open, timestamped review with reputational weighting.
	•	High APCs → low flat fees + revenue share (revnets), micro-bounties for review.
	•	Career signaling → on-chain profiles/NFT publications, verifiable impact trails.
Pricing insights
	•	Benchmarks: PLOS APCs ~$1.9k–$6.3k; F1000Research ≈ $937+ by type; Nature ≈ $12.3k. Position with low, transparent fees + optional revenue share to undercut APCs while rewarding contributors. The Official PLOS BlogF1000Researchnews.library.ualberta.ca
Positioning moves (actionable)
	•	Lead with “Publish, own 100%, earn”: rights, credibility, and rev-share.
	•	Wallet-optional onboarding + 1-page submissions to beat UX friction.
	•	Launch flagship niches (capstones, methods, datasets) to win early mindshare.
	•	Integrate open-review primitives (identity/report/public participation) as defaults. Wikipedia

📖 Short Brand Story
You’ve worked hard to create knowledge. But too often, your capstones, projects, and first publications disappear into dusty shelves, forgotten archives, or worse, into publishers’ hands where you lose all rights.

We built DeSci Reviews for authors like you: a decentralized publishing house where you own 100% of your work, turn it into a career asset, and start building credibility and authority from day one.
Science and knowledge should serve you and society. Your credibility and authority journey starts here at DeSci Reviews.

Prompt: List the top 5 objections to buying my product/service & write persuasive, trust-building responses to each.
❓ 1. “Do I really keep 100% of my rights?”
Response:Yes. Unlike traditional journals where you sign away copyright, with DeSci Reviews you keep full ownership. Your work is minted on-chain, with timestamped proof that can’t be revoked. You can even decide licensing terms. Your work stays yours - forever.

❓ 2. “But I don’t know blockchain/Web3. Isn’t this too technical?”
Response:No worries - we built it to be simple. Submissions are just a one-page form. Wallets are optional: you can start like a regular platform user, and later connect to blockchain benefits (tokens, NFTs) if you want. No technical expertise needed.

❓ 3. “Why pay when I can upload my work for free somewhere else (ResearchGate, Academia.edu, personal blog)?”
Response:Good question. The difference is authority + credibility. Blogs and free sites don’t give you copyright proof, peer review, or on-chain recognition. With DeSci Reviews your work becomes a career asset, cited, verified, and rewarded. Free uploads can vanish - your rights here can’t.

❓ 4. “How do I know people will actually see my work?”
Response:We’ve built in community promotion and spotlight features. Every published work is highlighted across our network, promoted on socials, and discoverable in a decentralized library. Plus, you earn a Credibility Badge that you can showcase on LinkedIn, CVs, or websites - boosting your visibility instantly.

❓ 5. “What if this project fails or disappears?”
Response:That’s the beauty of decentralization. Even if our team stopped tomorrow, your paper would remain permanently stored and verifiable on-chain. Unlike traditional journals, we can’t take your rights away or make your work vanish. Your research is safe, permanent, and under your control.

✨ Pro tip: Always tie responses back to your core value promise → “Publish. Own. Earn.”

1. 🎓 For Student & Graduate Networks
Subject: Helping students turn capstones into career assets
Hi [Name],
I’m Maria, founder of DeSci Reviews - a decentralized publishing house where graduates and early-career researchers keep 100% of their rights and transform their capstone projects into career-building assets.
I’d love to explore a partnership with [University/Association] to offer students an exclusive “Capstone Publishing Cohort.” It would give your members visibility, credibility, and a permanent record of their work.
Would you be open to a quick call to explore how this could benefit your community?
Warmly,Maria

2. 🪙 For DAOs & Web3 Communities
DM Script (X/Discord):
Hey [Name/DAO], 🚀I run DeSci Reviews (https://desci.reviews), a decentralized publishing platform giving authors full ownership of their work.
We’re exploring collabs with DAOs aligned with open knowledge + creator empowerment. Imagine your community publishing papers, essays, or whitepapers on-chain - with ownership + token rewards.
I think there’s a natural fit between [DAO] and DeSci Reviews. Want to jam on a cross-promo or pilot?
Best,Maria

Subject: Adding permanent publishing to [Platform/Bootcamp] outcomes
Hi [Name],
Congrats on all the impact you’re creating with [Bootcamp/Platform]! 🎉 I noticed students finish with amazing projects that often vanish after demo day.
At DeSci Reviews, we help students and professionals publish, own, and showcase their work with 100% rights, turning it into a portfolio asset that employers and investors respect.
I’d love to explore a partnership to give your learners this career-boosting edge. Even a pilot with one cohort could be powerful.
What do you think?
